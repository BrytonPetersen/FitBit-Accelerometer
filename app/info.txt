This folder contains the application logic which executes on the device. Code in this folder 
has access to the Device API and is capable of interacting directly with the presentation layer,
communicating with the companion, or reading and writing settings.

ONLY THE IONIC HAS THE GYROSCOPE
UNSURE OF ANY DEVICE THAT HAS AN ORIENTATION SENSOR

Acceleration towards the ground should always be 9.8 m/s^2. You can find orientation using that. Ergo, you can use it like a noisy orientation sensor. 

Linear acceleration = Accelerometer Data - gravity
Integral(linear acceleration) = velocity
Integral(velocity) = position

Any drift at all in the first integral creates even worse drift

(1 second of drift >= 20 cm of positional error)
